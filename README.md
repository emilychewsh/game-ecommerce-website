# CRUX GAMES SHOP - Game Ecommerce Web App

Welcome to my first React JS project! Using React \* Vite
Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This project uses React JS, some CSS to style and basic HTML to create a Single Page Application.
